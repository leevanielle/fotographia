Fotographia
--------------------

A terminal app to convert .cr2 to .jpg extension. The app helps to save memory on any Camera's SD card from needing to create duplicate image files (raw and jpg). Lastly, the small app aims to automate the manual labor of converting the raw images one-by-one using an alternative solution like Apple's Preview.

## Installation
```
 $ npm install -g fotographia
```

## Usage
  1. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of where all of your raw (.r2) images are located
  2. From the terminal: ```$ fotographia -c```
  3. You're done!

## Notes
* Depending on how many images you have, the converting processes could take a while.
